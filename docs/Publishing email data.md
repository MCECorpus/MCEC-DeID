# Publishing email data

Given the fact that email is a form of personal communication, and to the best of our knowledge there are no publicly-available corpora of emails except for the  [ENRON corpus](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/), the [Avocado corpus](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2015T03), and the like, it is reasonable to ask why can the MCEC Project disclose participant emails?

1. We have obtained IRB permission from our institution to conduct research in the manner that is outlined in this documentation. Our current IRB status is classified as a `minimal risk`.
2. We have received electronically informed consent from our particiapnts as outlined on Section 99.30, paragraphs (a-d) of FERPA.
3. We have de-identified records and information as outlined on Section 99.31, paragraph b(1).
4. We have in place confidentiality-protection workflows to exclude any `personally identifiable information` (primary or secondary) as well as any `education records`.
