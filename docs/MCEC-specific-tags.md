# MCEC-specific tags

The tags below have been created to protect identifiers not contemplated in the Safe Harbor method, but which directly or indirectly identify participant information or that of their "relatives, employers, or household members". There are two types of tags: educational record tags and personally identifiable information tags.

## Educational record tags

The U.S. Department of Education' protects students privacy via the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, also known as [FERPA](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/). According to FERPA, a [record](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/node/548/#0.1_se34.1.99_13) is: "any information recorded in any way, including, but not limited to, handwriting, print, computer media, video or audio tape, film, microfilm, and microfiche."

Educational records are defined by FERPA as:

"[...] those records that are:
(1) Directly related to a student; and
(2) Maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution.
[...]" ([34 CFR ยง 99.3.](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/node/548/#0.1_se34.1.99_13))

Some exaples of educational records can be found [here](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/faq/what-education-record#:~:text=These%20records%20include%20but%20are,)%2C%20and%20student%20discipline%20files.).

There are a few exceptions to what a protected educational record is. These exceptions include "[r]ecords that are kept in the sole possession of the maker", "[g]rades on peer-graded papers before they are collected and recorded by a teacher", among others. For more information, please consult the online documentation [here](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/node/548/#0.1_se34.1.99_13).

Taking into account these definitions, the MCEC has defined the following tags:

## Personally identifiable information

FERPA defines certain personally identifiable information [(34 CFR ยง 99.3.)](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/ferpa#0.1_se34.1.99_13), some of which overlaps with HIPAA privacy items. The table below compares HIPAA vs FERPA-defined identifiers:
